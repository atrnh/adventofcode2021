</small><br><br>

This isn't my first Advent of Code. I'm already familiar with the way these challenges are
generally structured. Each challenge has two parts but...!

*...you don't get to see Part 2 until you've solved Part 1.*

*This* is what I come to Advent of Code for &mdash; Part 2 is always a twist that'll
test the engineering choices you made in Part 1.

## Part 1

**The gist of Part 1:** given a list of measurements and count the number of times they
increase between one measurement and the next.

For example:

###### Here's the example list

<pre>
<del>199</del>
<b>200 âŒƒ</b>
<b>208 âŒƒ</b>
<b>210 âŒƒ</b>
<del>200 âŒ„</del>
<b>207 âŒƒ</b>
<b>240 âŒƒ</b>
<b>269 âŒƒ</b>
<del>260 âŒ„</del>
<b>263 âŒƒ</b>
</pre>

...this list gives us `7` increases.

### My solution

Whenever I approach the first part of any Advent of Code challenge, I try to anticipate
what might come next in Part 2...

Since we're doing *something* to one number and the
proceeding number, I guessed that the *something* might change.

If you've already solved this one, you'll know that I guessed wrong (this is exactly why
Advent of Code is fun though), but here's what I did:

```python
def do_with_next(iterable, func):
    results = []

    prev = None
    for el in iterable:
        if prev is not None:
            results.append(func(prev, el))

        prev = el

    return results
```

Then, we can count depth increases like so:

```python
def count_depth_incr(depths):
    increases = [
        1 if is_increased else 0
        for is_increased in do_with_next(depths, lambda x, y: x < y)
    ]
    return sum(increases)
```

## Part 2

Still working on the explainer for Part 2 ğŸ˜€.
