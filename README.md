It's the most wonderful time of the year! ☃️ 🎁 ❄️

## How to use this repo

Each solution lives in its own module and reads puzzle input from **stdin**.

###### Example command to run `day01`

```sh
cat input.txt | python3 -m day01
```

Solutions marked with a 🎄 include explanations in their readmes. I like writing explainers for
particularly interesting or fun solutions &mdash; they're a great way for me to practice
storytelling and writing about technical subjects &mdash; so check them out if you're into
that type of thing 🚀

### Solutions

- [Day 1 🎄](day01)
- [Day 2](day02)
- [Day 3 🎄](day03)
